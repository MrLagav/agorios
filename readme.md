# Agorios

Agorios is a Python-based data science project focused on scraping data from popular marketplaces and performing analysis on the collected data.

## Introduction

I am starting this project for fun! Agorios aims to leverage data collection techniques to gather valuable insights from these marketplaces, enabling users to make informed decisions based on market trends, pricing dynamics, and other key factors.

## Features
(Well that's the plan - We will reach it commit by commit :P) </br>
